We try to make blind children visualize the world around them by using their available senses. We use drawing as a medium and crayonas a tool. Indian Blind schools have all the subjects except Drawing and Painting. Our effort is to establish drawing as a subject in India. There are special devices through which the feel of the lines and drawings becomes easier for them. We teach them shapes, sizes, curves, lines and geometrical structures. This help them to understand other subjects also. They are living a mundane life based on donation and sympathy. It is our objective to provide empowerment to visually impaired individuals so that they can live a quality life outside their premises. We teach them to write using ourdevices so that they can writethe way normal children write. Once the subject is established in India,the talented children will be appointedas paid volunteers and teachers. In this way, the blind children will get employment.",
