Delhi has 19 schools and centers serving the blind. Our mission is to cover remote and deprived schools of India. The blind is living a mundane life based on donation and sympathy.

It is our objective to provide empowerment and a sense of being so that they can cope in the world outside these premisesInside Me teaches drawing to empower these youth. Increased exposure to drawing will help the blind understand and represent space concept and symbolic relations. Visual art or drawing improves both academic achievement and performance on standardized testsUnfortunately, drawing as a subject for students with visual impairment has not been incorporated in India But we hope to change that.",
